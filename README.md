# XS Overlay Join Notifyer for Resonite

This script is used to give bot joining or leaving notifications from Resonite to your XS Overlay. It also can be modified to send other messages as well within the post body. ~~More on that later~~ The script supports custom sounds in ogg format for your notifications.

To use the custom sounds with your notifications, make a folder next to the executable or path of where the program is running in called `sounds`, in there you want to place your ogg files with the corrisponding names to the notification.

For example:

* default.ogg
* warning.ogg
* error.ogg
* join.ogg
* leave.ogg
* spawned.ogg ~~No longer in use~~

## How to use

This application is a reciever for my ProtoFluX script within Resonite, you can get it by public folder. Paste this link into the game if you don't have my folder `resrec:///U-ScarsTRF/R-24fa7e05-4617-431f-a1ee-8ee00515b065` Inside of there, you want to go to `Script Flux//XSO Join Notifyer` And install the Flux into your avatar with the self installer.

After you have installed and prepped all your flux onto your avatar, you just want to have this application running on your system while Resonite is running either by manually double clicking it or having it run automatically.

## Notice

This app does **NOT** install onto your PC, you'll need to find a way to have this app run as a service or next to Resonite if you want this to run automatically as it is required for the Flux to communicate with XS Overlay.
